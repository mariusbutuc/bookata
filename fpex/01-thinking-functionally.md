## Chapter 1: Thinking Functionally

### Why Functional?

  - programming paradigm
    + rules
    + design principles of building software.

  - need: concurrency and parallelism

  - versus imperative and object-oriented
    + shared mutating values

### Functional Programming

  - programming paradigm
    + functions are basic building blocks
    + all values are immutable
    + the code is declarative

  - the lambda calculus computation model
    + Alonzo Church, 1930s
    + anonymous functions
    + free and bound variables
    + functions as first-class citizens

  - Elixir promises
    + better use of CPU multicores
    + shorter code
    + more explicit code

  - Elixir's price: understand and follow core principles
    + immutability
    + functions
    + declarative code
