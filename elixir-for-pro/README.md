# Elixir for Programmers, Second Edition [â†—][course]

![44%](https://progress-bar.dev/44)

> Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView, paced for folks who can already program.

## The Hangman Game - The Plan

- [x] 1.  The dictionary module

  - It lets us select a random word for our game

- [x] 2. The game logic

  - Separate application + manage dependencies
  - Split code into small modules using the _Single Responsibility Principle_

- [ ] 3. The text-based client

  - Maintain _application state_ in _a functional language_

- [ ] 4. "Elixir is good at concurrent programming"

  - Look at processes and _the actor model_
  - Convert the hangman game to use these ideas

- [ ] 5. Managing large (and small) deployments

  - Use _the OTP framework_ to finish off the core of hangman

- [ ] 6. The web front ends

  - Use _the Phoenix framework_ to add two web front ends to the application:
    1. a straight HTML application
    2. a single-page app written using _LiveView_
