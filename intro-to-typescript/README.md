# Introduction to TypeScript <sup>[course]</sup>

Introduction to TypeScript teaches you everything you need to know to get
started writing awesome web apps with TypeScript. First, you’ll review the
relevant ECMAScript foundations that will enhance your first steps down the
TypeScript road. Then, after setting up your programming environment, you’ll
explore primitive data types like Boolean, numbers, and strings, as well as
non-primitive data types like arrays, tuples, and enums. Your next stop will be
object-oriented programming concepts including interfaces, classes, access
modifiers, and abstract methods.
As you work through this course, you’ll discover generics and how to use them,
and progress further into typings, including how to apply them to third-party
libraries. You’ll also learn to efficiently transpile TypeScript to JavaScript
with and without the open-source module bundler Webpack. With the 45
comprehensive videos in this course, you’ll have a rock-solid foundation and a
collection of instantly-useful skills for building strong, safe, web apps!
