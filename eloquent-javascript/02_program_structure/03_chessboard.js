/**
 * Chessboard
 *
 * Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using
 * newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is
 * either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
 *
 * Passing this string to `console.log` should show something like this:
 *
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *
 * When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding
 * `size = 8` and change the program so that it works for any `size`, outputting
 * a grid of the given width and height.
