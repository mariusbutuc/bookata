## Contents

- [x] 0. Introduction

### Part 1: Language

- [x] 1. [Values, Types, and Operators][ch01]
- [x] 2. [Program Structure][ch02]
- [x] 3. [Functions][ch03]

  #### Highlights

  - The 3 different ways of creating functions
  - Scope: global, local, block, nested, lexical
  - The call stack
  - Optional arguments
  - Closures: function values contain both the code and the environment in which
    they were created
  - Recursion: human-friendliness (elegance) versus machine-friendliness (speed)
  - Functions and side effects: pure functions and computing speed

  #### Extracurricular

  - Document the intent behind the implemented code using [JSDoc].
  - Follow the community style guidelines by using
    [vscode's prettier extension][prettier] to automatically format the code
    when saving a file.
  - Shorten the feedback loop by using [nodemon] to automatically run the code
    for the exercise everytime the file is saved.
