# Lab #2: How do we produce a Docker image without a Dockerfile?
#   Sample solution: https://github.com/sixeyed/diamol/tree/master/ch03/lab

set -x

# Task
#   1. Start with an image from Docker Hub: `diamol/ch03-lab`.
#       - The image contains a file at the path `/diamol/ch03.txt`.
#   2. Update the text file to add my name at the end.
#   3. Produce a new image with the changed file.
#       - All without using a `Dockerfile`.

CONTAINER_NAME="03_lab"
IMAGE_NAME=${CONTAINER_NAME}_image
NAME="Marius"
TEXT_FILE_PATH="/diamol/ch03.txt"

# 1. Start with an image from Docker Hub: `diamol/ch03-lab`.
