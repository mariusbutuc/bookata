## Modules

- [x] 1. Introduction
  - When installing Ruby, I prefer `asdf` over `rbenv`: can use this for Elixir and other languages as well.
- [x] 2. Running Ruby
  - [VS Code extensions](vs_code_extensions.md)
- [x] 3. Numbers and Strings
- [x] 4. Variables and Objects
  - Documentation with `RDoc` and `ri`
  - ⚠️ Effects of [passing by "object reference"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10974116/341929)
- [x] 5. Self
  - The implicit receiver
- [x] 6. Methods
  - Lexical scoping
  - The Single Responsibility Principle
- [x] 7. Classes
  - Encapsulate state (instance variables) and behaviour (instance methods).
  - The constructor method, `initialize`, sets up the state for the instance/object.
- [x] 8. Attributes
  - Expose only as little internal/private state as possible to maintain high flexibility & adaptability to change.
- [x] 9. Arrays
  - One of Ruby's two (2) built-in collection classes.
  - An array is an _ordered_ list of object references.
