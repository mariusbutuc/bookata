# Creating Your First App

![27.27%](https://progress-bar.dev/27/)

### Goals:

Build a notes app that will allow users to create, update, and delete notes.

1. Broaden understanding of **GraphQL** by creating a GraphQL API.
2. Use the GraphQL API to interact with a **DynamoDB** NoSQL database.
3. Use the GraphQL API to perform CRUD+L (create, read, update, delete, and list) operations.
4. Explore GraphQL subscriptions to see updates in **real time**.
